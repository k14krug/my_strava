# Project Brief

## Overview
A personal Strava analytics application running on a Raspberry Pi, providing detailed training analysis and visualization through a web interface accessible on the local network.

## Goals
1. Create a reliable Strava data synchronization system with robust error handling
2. Develop advanced fitness analysis features with accurate training load metrics
3. Build an intuitive user interface with comprehensive data visualization
4. Implement secure authentication and session management
5. Ensure data quality through validation and logging

## Key Features
- Strava API integration with rate limit handling
- Training load analysis (CTL, ATL, TSB)
- Fitness fatigue modeling and visualization
- Secure user authentication with session management
- Detailed activity data visualization
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Technical Requirements
- Python backend with Flask web framework
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database management
- Background job processing for data synchronization
- REST API integration with Strava
- MariaDB database for data storage
- Detailed logging and monitoring system
- Data validation and quality checks

## Development Environment
- Primary development on Windows PC via VSCode
- SSH connection to Raspberry Pi for deployment
- MariaDB database hosted on Raspberry Pi
- Local network access for web interface
- Virtual environment for Python dependencies

## Security Considerations
- Secure storage of API credentials
- Encrypted session management
- Rate limiting and API error handling
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular security updates
