## Planned work

### STRAVA-001 — Inventory latest Strava bulk export

**Status:** done

**Purpose:** Inspect Ken's latest local Strava bulk export and produce a compact, reproducible inventory that tells us what source data actually exists before detailed import design begins.

**Scope summary:**

* inspect the export structure and `activities.csv`
* inventory activity-file formats and historical coverage
* identify associations, obvious gaps, and unusual cases useful for later investigation
* produce compact machine-readable and human-readable outputs suitable for Analyst review
* keep the raw export and personal activity archive out of Git

**Acceptance:** See `docs/tasks/STRAVA-001.md`.

**Dependency:** Workflow bootstrap complete.

### STRAVA-002 — Deep inspect representative activity files

**Status:** in_progress

**Purpose:** Deeply inspect the STRAVA-001 diagnostic candidates and compare source-file evidence with Strava CSV metadata before making importer or historical-data-model decisions.

**Scope summary:**

* parse the 23 candidate FIT/TCX/GPX files at a diagnostic level
* compare source-file evidence with corresponding `activities.csv` rows
* characterize signal availability, timing behavior, device/session/lap metadata, and power provenance evidence
* characterize the 13 CSV rows without filename references
* keep raw activity streams and personal source files out of Git

**Acceptance:** See `docs/tasks/STRAVA-002.md`.

**Dependency:** STRAVA-001 complete.

## Follow-up work

Further tasks will be chosen from STRAVA-002 evidence. A likely direction is whole-history signal/data-quality coverage, but that is not yet a committed task or design decision.
